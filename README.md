**Business Problem:-** In this particular business use case, objective  is to build an interactive dashboard, through which the bank management can track their customer data, and draw meaningful insights from it. The dashboard will allow the management to take data driven business decisions, for example management want to target a particular section of customers, to whom they can extend an offer, or want to offer some investment plans etc.

**Dataset:-** The source of the dataset is kaggle. It is available in csv format. The dataset has following features/columns.

- Customer ID          -non-null int64
- Name                 -non-null object
- Surname              -non-null object

- Date Joined          -non-null object
- Balance              -non-null float64


**Technologies used:-** I have utilized python 3, Jupyter notebook, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib Microsoft power bi desktop and
Microsoft excel.

**Flow of the project:-**
- Load the dataset to jupyter notebook into an pandas dataframe (used python to perform all the steps in jupyter notebook)
- Check for duplicate rows.
- Check for null values.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the data
- Add extra columns to dataset required to serve the purpose.
- Cleaning the data for further processes to be followed.
- Save the dataset.
- Load the dataset in Power BI.
- Build the dashboard and save the report.

**Files:-**
The bank_analysis.ipynb file is the jupyter notebook,contains the python code.
The bank.ppix is the Power BI report.
The Dashboard.pdf file contains the dashboard that I have build during the course of the project.
